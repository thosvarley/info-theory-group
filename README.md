Readings + Notebooks from a self-organizing reading group on information theory in complex systems

The goal is that, by the end of the semester, there will be enough information here to bring any aspiring complex systems scientist interested in information theory (which should be all of them) from total beginner to reasonably familiar with the core logic and structures. 

This also may serve as the foundation to a formal course in Information Theory for Complex Systems Scientists down the line (if I (Thomas) ever get hired to be a professor). 

To make the Jupyter Notebooks more enjoyable to read in a web browser, use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/. Or just download the notebook. Either one works.
